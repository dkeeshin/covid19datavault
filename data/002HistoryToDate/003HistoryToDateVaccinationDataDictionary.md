| ColumnName | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| CollectionDate | date data was collected, assigned by kDS|
| location |  name of the country (or region within a country). |
| iso_code |  ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 â€“ three-letter country codes. |
| date |  date of the observation. |
| total_vaccinations |  total number of doses administered. This is counted as a single dose, and may not equal the total number of people vaccinated, depending on the specific dose regime (e.g. people receive multiple doses). If a person receives one dose of the vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive a second dose, it goes up by 1 again. |
| total_vaccinations_per_hundred |  total_vaccinations per 100 people in the total population of the country. |
|  daily_vaccinations_raw |  daily change in the total number of doses administered. It is only calculated for consecutive days. This is a raw measure provided for data checks and transparency, but we strongly recommend that any analysis on daily vaccination rates be conducted using daily_vaccinations instead. |
| daily_vaccinations |  new doses administered per day (7-day smoothed). For countries that don't report data on a daily basis, we assume that doses changed equally on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported. This produces a complete series of daily figures, which is then averaged over a rolling 7-day window. An example of how we perform this calculation can be found here. |
| daily_vaccinations_per_million |  daily_vaccinations per 1,000,000 people in the total population of the country. |
| people_vaccinated |  total number of people who received at least one vaccine dose. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive the second dose, the metric stays the same. |
| people_vaccinated_per_hundred |  people_vaccinated per 100 people in the total population of the country. |
| people_fully_vaccinated |  total number of people who received all doses prescribed by the vaccination protocol. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric stays the same. If they receive the second dose, the metric goes up by 1. |
| people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred |  people_fully_vaccinated per 100 people in the total population of the country. |
